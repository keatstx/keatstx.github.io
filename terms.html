    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective August 19, 2025</p>
    <p>These Terms of Service describe the agreement between Glowline Creative LLC (“Glowline,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) and the client or site visitor (“you”). By accessing our website or engaging our services, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Services</h2>
    <p>Glowline provides AI-powered marketing solutions for medspas and aesthetic clinics, including short-form video, paid social, hyper‑local SEO, reputation programs, conversion-focused websites, and email/SMS nurture (the “Services”). The specific scope, deliverables, fees, and timeline are defined in a written proposal, order form, or statement of work (“SOW”).</p>

    <h2>2. Engagement and Client Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide timely access to brand assets, product information, subject matter experts, and platform accounts needed to perform the Services.</li>
      <li>Secure rights and permissions to all materials you supply, including testimonials, images, and before‑and‑after photos.</li>
      <li>Review and approve deliverables within the timeframes set in the SOW so campaigns can launch and optimize on schedule.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. AI Disclosures</h2>
    <p>We use AI tools to assist with research, scripting, editing, creative generation, optimization, and reporting. Human review is applied to protect accuracy, brand voice, and clinical integrity. You acknowledge that AI outputs can contain errors and agree to review and approve content before publication.</p>

    <h2>4. Clinical and Advertising Compliance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You are responsible for the clinical accuracy of claims, disclosures, and before‑and‑after representations. Avoid unsubstantiated outcomes or guarantees.</li>
      <li>You will follow all applicable laws and platform policies, including FTC advertising guidelines, state medical board rules, HIPAA where applicable, and Meta/TikTok/Google policies.</li>
      <li>We may decline or pause content that appears noncompliant or risky.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. PHI and HIPAA</h2>
    <p>Glowline is a marketing services provider and not a covered entity. We do not require access to protected health information (“PHI”) to perform the Services. If a project requires handling PHI, the parties will execute a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) before any PHI is shared and will limit use to the minimum necessary.</p>

    <h2>6. Platform Access and Third‑Party Tools</h2>
    <p>You grant Glowline permission to access and manage your advertising, analytics, CRM, and website platforms solely to deliver the Services. Your use of third‑party tools is governed by those providers’ terms. We are not responsible for outages, policy changes, account suspensions, or data loss caused by third parties.</p>

    <h2>7. Fees, Invoicing, and Expenses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Service fees are outlined in the SOW. Media spend is billed directly by advertising platforms unless stated otherwise.</li>
      <li>Invoices are due upon receipt and payable within 15 days unless the SOW specifies different terms.</li>
      <li>Late amounts may accrue a reasonable service charge. We may pause work for past‑due balances.</li>
      <li>Pre‑approved out‑of‑pocket expenses will be billed at cost.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Your Materials</strong>. You retain ownership of assets you supply. You grant Glowline a nonexclusive license to use those assets to perform the Services.</li>
      <li><strong>Deliverables</strong>. Upon full payment, you receive a worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty‑free license to use final deliverables for your business. Glowline retains rights to underlying workflows, templates, know‑how, pre‑existing materials, and AI prompts.</li>
      <li><strong>Portfolio</strong>. Unless the SOW states otherwise, we may showcase non‑confidential work product and results in our portfolio and marketing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>Each party agrees to protect the other’s nonpublic information and use it only for the engagement. These obligations continue for three years after termination, except for trade secrets which remain protected while secret.</p>

    <h2>10. Term, Termination, and Effects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Either party may terminate an SOW for material breach if not cured within 15 days of written notice.</li>
      <li>Either party may terminate for convenience on 30 days’ written notice unless the SOW specifies a different term.</li>
      <li>Upon termination, you will pay for Services performed and approved expenses through the effective date. We will provide any in‑progress files and reasonable transition assistance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>We warrant that we will provide the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner. Except as expressly stated, the Services and deliverables are provided “as is.” We do not guarantee specific rankings, impressions, clicks, leads, or revenue.</p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither party will be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or lost profits. Except for payment obligations, confidentiality breaches, or IP infringement, each party’s aggregate liability under these Terms will not exceed the fees paid to Glowline for the three months preceding the claim.</p>

    <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You agree to indemnify and defend Glowline against claims arising from your content, your unlawful or noncompliant use of the Services, or your violation of third‑party rights.</li>
      <li>Glowline agrees to indemnify and defend you against claims that our pre‑existing IP used in the Services infringes a third party’s IP right.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>14. Non‑Solicitation</h2>
    <p>During the term of an active SOW and for six months after, neither party will solicit for employment personnel of the other who directly worked on the engagement, except through general job postings.</p>

    <h2>15. Governing Law; Disputes</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the state specified in your SOW, without regard to conflicts principles. The parties will first attempt to resolve disputes in good faith. If unresolved after 30 days, disputes will be submitted to binding arbitration in the same state and county, except claims for injunctive relief which may be brought in court.</p>

    <h2>16. Updates to these Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. The “Effective” date above reflects the latest version. Material changes will be posted on this page.</p>
